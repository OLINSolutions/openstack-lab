# openstack-lab

## Overview
This project is used to track the artifacts and resources related to building a lab environment for hosting OpenStack (starting with Caracal). Some of the content was developed with the aid of [Anthropic's Claude][def-claude].
At the end of this project, my goal was to have a production-like, secure, and highly available OpenStack environment that would cover the following:
* Design a comprehensive architecture
  * Create a robust network topology with dedicated segments for management, storage, and external traffic
  * Design an efficient hardware allocation strategy maximizing the utility of each server
  * Implement redundancy at multiple levels (network bonds, RAID arrays, dual controllers)
* Implement Physical Infrastructure
  * Configure network switches with appropriate segmentation
  * Set up network bonding for high availability
  * Implement jumbo frames for storage performance
  * Configure various RAID levels appropriate to each use case
* Deploy Operating System and Base Configuration
  * Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on all nodes
  * Configure network interfaces and security settings
  * Set up storage systems with appropriate filesystems and mount points
  * Optimize system parameters for OpenStack workloads
* Prepare for OpenStack Deployment
  * Configure [Kolla-Ansible][def-kolla-ansible]deployment tools
  * Set up SSH key-based authentication between nodes
  * Create comprehensive deployment parameters
  * Verify all prerequisites for successful deployment
* Setup a private cloud with SSL/TLS using OpenStack Caracal
  * Deploy a full OpenStack environment using Kolla-Ansible
